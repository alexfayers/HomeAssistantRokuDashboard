# Home assistant dashboard for Roku!

Roku's display API sucks, so this works instead of the a lovelace dashboard.

# usage

- rename config.json.example to config.json and put in your deets
- edit the code if you want
- zip everything in the src directory
- install the zip via dev mode on your roku (https://blog.roku.com/developer/developer-setup-guide)
- ???
- profit

p.s. i used the [brightscript language extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RokuCommunity.brightscript) for vscode to develop this, and it saved me a lot of time.

# todo
- comment stuff
- change icons
- maybe media player stuff
- config from server instead of bundled into app
